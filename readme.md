## Background
First Jam, focusing on getting something out the door.  
Practicing putting together a minimum viable product.

A simplistic approach to "More is worse", the more powerups and cash you collect, the more and stronger enemies are.

## Gameplay
Side-scrolling shooter, blow up the enemies, dodge the blocks, and collect the powerups.

And get more sturdy as you heal and increase your max health.
